# BSPWM configurations by cahayazulkafli.

Red and black contrast theme.

Mainly for Arch and Gentoo (with slight modifications of rofi shell scripts), but still usable for other distributions.

# Required dependencies:
- bspwm (Tiling window manager to use)
- sxhkd (Keybinding daemon)
- polybar (Bar panel)
- rofi (Run launcher and powermenu)
- git (To git clone this repository)
- alacritty (Terminal)
- picom-jonaburg (Other picom forks are okay)
- dunst (Notification daemon)
- nerd-fonts (Icons in the panel and terminal)
- nitrogen (Wallpaper setter)

# Important things to do after cloning this repository!

Don't forget to chmod +x all shell scripts that is in this repository.
Failure to do so will make your desktop unusable.

Audit files thoroughly and edit as you see fit (you WILL edit some stuff, mainly bspwmrc and sxhkdrc).
